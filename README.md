# pandas-challange-1
Pandas Challange AI Bootcamp due 12/24/2024

## Project Overview
1. From client_dataset.csv file create data frames, manipulate as needed
2. Since I have SQL background it is easier to understand the end goal, but I still have to learn to think in Python

## How I did my work
1. Follow the instructions on the Jupyter Notebook starter file
2. Use lesson 4_1, 4_2, and 4_3 for the command lines
3. Received help from ChatGPT, Google, and Claude.AI, modified things that needed to be done to comply with instructions
4. Debut and test multiple times

## Output Examples
